# Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation

The music recommendations made by Spotify, a music app, are excellent. It recommends music based on the songs and artists you usually listen to. The algorithm groups comparable features into clusters, and these clusters aid in comprehending the auditory properties of diverse songs. Use this specific data set to construct an automated system.

For this project, we have:

Performed data pre-processing operations.

As a part of data analysis and visualizations drawn all the possible plots to provide essential informations and to derive some meaningful 
insights.

Shown correlation matrix of features according to the datasets.

Found and plotted different clusters according to different parameters like playlist genres, playlist names.
